How I got it running::

    pip install mezzanine
    git clone git://github.com/kevinlondon/kevinlondon.com-mezzanine.git

Will be using this as a base for redesign but going to develop in plain Django
myself, I think. I'm using this as a learning tool for Django and for me,
the best way to learn it is to use it from the ground-up.
